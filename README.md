## 🔍 Key Features

- 📊 **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance, FRED, Quandl  
- 🔧 **Preprocessing**: Forward-filling, lag features, Min-Max normalization  
- 📈 **Models Used**:
  - ARIMA (benchmark)
  - Random Forest
  - GRU (Recurrent Neural Network)
  - CNN-LSTM (Hybrid Deep Learning)
- 📉 **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, RMSE, R²
- 🔄 **Validation Strategy**: Nested time-series cross-validation with forward chaining
